# Portfolio Website
This is a portfolio website that I made. There are still some changes to be made which I will in the coming time.

Edit: So I made a brand new website, this might not look like a mainstream one page portfolio website that you come across alot of times. I took a different take and have written the code in a different way to practice different styles to development.

Also I have integrated JS in the website written in jQuery. I needed some practice on that, so I implemented a dark-light theme to go with it too.

Do review the site here and give your feedback. Also if you like what I have made or a style I chose, you are free to have a look at its code.

I would be making minor changes in the future, so be on the lookout for those.

Thank you!
